Customers are also facing with a fragmented SAP BW system landscape, resulting in data silos. Historically grown SAP BW systems need to be managed, demanding high maintenance effort and providing housekeeping potential. Customers see challenges in making the right data asset available for the respective users to be leveraged in a timely manner. To keep their investments already made in SAP BW and address existing challenges with Innovation Deficits , we are now evolving from a business data fabric architecture into the business data cloud where we make the BW journey for existing customers even simpler than before. By lifting SAP BW to the cloud (PCE), customers are enabled to leverage BW data as a data product, while taking advantage of a holistically SAP-managed environment, removing hardware maintenance and lowering TCO for customers. We can implement new use cases using BW data products which are directly accessible via the object store of SAP Datasphere. Leveraging the advantage of semantically defined BW data products to match the needs for further data transformation and modelling, we can also benefit from the open partner ecosystem and create ML/AI use cases using BW data products in Databricks",
