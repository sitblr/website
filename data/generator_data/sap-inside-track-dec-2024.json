By lifting SAP BW to the cloud (PCE), customers are enabled to leverage BW data as a data product, while taking advantage of a holistically SAP-managed environment, lowering TCO for customers.We can implement new use cases using BW data products which are directly accessible via object store of SAP Datasphere and leverage semantic onboarding for further transformation.",
